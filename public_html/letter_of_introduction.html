                        The app started as a collaboration project between OAMK and FONTYS. The OAMK students were responsible for the frontend and the FONTYS students were responsible for the backend. We chose to do an score keeping application. The application was supposed to be applicable for all kinds of games, not just for sports. The course ended in the spring of 2016.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The OAMK students decided to continue building the application. We wrote a completely new backend. We took as our goal the original projects sprint one task list. You have in front of you our alpha version 0,1.
